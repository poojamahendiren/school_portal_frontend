                 Today, we educate over 16,000 students in 13 Campuses every year.
            Education, for us, is the process by which character is formed, strength of the mind is increased, 
                and intellect is sharpened, and as a result of which one can stand on one's own feet.
                We strive at creating a stimulating environment where children learn because they want to and not because they have to. </p>
